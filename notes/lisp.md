**LISP**: LISt processor because the source code is comprised of lists.

Developed by John McCarthy in 1958, Lisp is the first **functional language**.

**ELisp** (Emacs Lisp) is a variant of Lisp used to write and extend the Emacs application.

An example of **app-specific language (ASL)**. In some extent, it's an example of the _little languages philosophy_. Creators of Emacs took an existing language and mutated it to suit their particular problem.

## Namespace and Security

Emacs is very traditional - a flat, top-level namespace that can be prone to clashing. You have a lot of liberty in making problematic changes. This is allowed for example:

```lisp
emacs-version
; "28.2"
(setq emacs-version "100.0")
; "100.0"
(setq emacs-version "100.0")

; You can also mess around safely with scoped variables:
(let ((emacs-version "19.2"))
  (message "A %s" emacs-version)
  )
; "A 19.2"
```

Trying to evaluate a variable that's never been assigned, you get a _runtime error_, very reliably. There is _well-defined behavior_, as opposed to _undefined behavior_ like in C/C++, the former which is obviously _safer_. The Emacs debugger also provides a traceback, but it reads bottom to top. To exit from the debugger, enter `C-]`

> Scripting languages thus tend to be used for exploratory programs, student codes, one-off programs, etc.

```lisp
(message "You can %s like printf!" "interpolate")
; "You can interpolate like printf!"
```

## Fundamental Data Structures

Emacs uses the same notation for programs and data. In other words, we use **data notation** to write our programs. The fundamental data structure in Lisp is the **list**, which is built from **cons**, which is just a pair of values. A list is singly-linked list of cons.

```
# This is a cons
[A|B]
(A . B)

# This is a list
[A| ]->[B| ]->[C| ]->[D| ]->[E|/]
(A B C D E)

# You can use . to write at the cons level
[A| ]->[B| ]->[C|D]
(A B C . D)

# The empty list; also used as the null terminator
()

# Thus this is equivalent to (A B C D E)
(A B C D E . ())

# Nested lists
[A| ]->[ | ]->[D|/]
        v
       [B| ]->[C|/]
(A (B C) D)
```

In Emacs, the _empty list_ is like the _null pointer_ - its byte representation is all 0s as well.

## Emacs Byte-code

You can load external source code into the current namespace with:

```
M-x load-file RET filename RET
```

As a solution to slow interpreting speed (due to the extensive use of pointers and dereferencing), ELisp uses **byte-codes** to compile data structures to create compact representations of a program.

Byte-code differs from machine code:

- **PRO:** byte-code is _portable_ and works on any architecture as it is designed for some abstract machine that the Emacs application knows about.
- **CON:** Not as performant as machine code.

From the GNU documentation:

> Emacs Lisp has a compiler that translates functions written in Lisp into a special representation called byte-code that can be executed more efficiently. The compiler replaces Lisp function definitions with byte-code. When a byte-code function is called, its definition is evaluated by the byte-code interpreter.

The numbers are analogous to opcodes in true machine code. Each number represents a certain elementary operation, like pushing data onto stack memory, adding two values, etc.

For example, abstractly, this may be the compiled byte-code for some function:

```assembly
  1 push a (arg #1)
 10 dup
 27 *
  2 push b (arg #2)
 10 dup
 27 *
 26 +
105 sqrt
```

Strung together they are functionally equivalent to the original Emacs function from which it was compiled, but now it can be compactly represented with a byte stream `1 10 27 2 10 27 26 105`.

This in turn is more performant than uncompiled Emacs code because it can be run directly by a byte-code interpreter, in contrast to high-level language that needs to be parsed (tokenized and semantically analyzed) before executing - going off of some scattered knowledge here, anyone feel free to correct me.

The byte-code files end with the `.elc` extension. You can compile a `.el` _source_ file with:

```emacs
M-x byte-compile-file RET filename.elc RET
```

`.elc` files can be loaded in the same way as `.el` files with `load-file`.

> Generally, you'd want to keep both the .el (so you can make future changes) and the .elc (so you get a performance gain) files on hand. But we're also talking about scripting in this class, and with the sizes of our scripts, this compiled/uncompiled speed difference is not noticeable (so bothering to make a .elc file in the first place is.. questionable. But it's good to know its purpose and that it's how Lisp works under the hood). **- Nik Brandt (Piazza)**

## The Emacs Interpreter

Is a _single-threaded interpreter_. There is only one instruction pointer (e.g. `%rip` on x86-64) at all times.

There's also a byte-code interpreter, which has some byte-code instruction pointer. Emacs is itself a C program, so under the hood it's something like:

```c
// points to current instruction in byte-code sequence
unsigned char *bcip;
```

## Customizing Key Binds

```lisp
(global-set-key "@" "abcxyz")
; Now typing "@" is automatically replaced with "abcxyz"

; This is like setting keyboad macros:
(global-set-key "@", 'what-cursor-position)
; Now typing "@" automatically shows cursor position in minibuffer
```

This could be a security hazard, because you can also include control characters. Emacs does provide an easy way to write control characters as strings:

```lisp
"\C-k" ; C-j
"^K"
```

Emacs however checks if you attempt to recurse like:

```lisp
(global-set-key "!" "!")
; After 0 kbd macro iterations: Lisp nesting exceeds ‘max-lisp\
; -eval-depth’
```

<!-- TODO: DISCUSSION NOTES BELOW -->

## Elisp within Emacs

- You can use `M-: RET` to enter an `Eval` minibuffer.
- You can also eval a line in a main buffer by moving the cursor to the end of the Lisp list and then entering `C-x C-e.`.
- You can directly enter an initial buffer without a file called the \*scratch\* buffer. You do this by pressing `q` right after starting up Emacs.

**Lisp interaction mode:**

- Move cursor to end of Lisp expression line.
- `C-j` to evaluate this line.
- Output will be shown and written to the buffer.
- Use instead of `C-x C-e` if you want the history to be saved in the buffer itself.

## The Language

**Atoms** are words that cannot be divided into any smaller parts, such as:

- Numbers: 30, #b111 (binary), #x6e3 (hexadecimal)
- Strings: "Hello", "buffer-name"

### Variables

Define and set a variable:

```lisp
defvar x 5
defvar y 5
```

Set the value of an existing variable:

```lisp
setq x 5
setq y 5
```

Local binding:

```lisp
(let ((a 1) (b 2)) ; local binding
    (+ a b)        ; body
)
```

### Expressions

The general syntax is `([Prefix] argument_1 argument_2 ...)`

Written as lists using _prefix notation_:

```lisp
(+ 1 2)
```

Recursive (nested) expressions:

```lisp
(* (+ 1 2) (+ 2 3))
```

**The `quote` Function:**

This will return the data structure itself i.e. `(+ 1 2)` instead of the result of its evaluation i.e. `3`:

```lisp
(quote (+ 1 2))
'(+ 1 2) ; shorthand
```

### Control Flow

Comparison operator:

```lisp
(= 1 2)
(> 2 2)
```

If statements:

```lisp
(if (= 1 2));
    "Yes"; will run if true
    "No";  will run if false
)
```

Here `;` is used to separate the lines of code, not only marking the start of comments.

### Functions

```lisp
(defun function-name (arguments...)
    "optional-documetation..."
    (interactive argument-passing-info) ; optional
    ; body
)
```

Example:

```lisp
(defun multiply-by-thirty-five (number)
    "Multiply NUMBER by Thirty Five."
    (* 35 number)
)

; calling the function
(multiply-by-thirty-five 2) ; 70
```

```lisp
; you can define a function to be interactive
; such functions can be called via M-x
(defun add (x y) (interactive) (+ x y)
```

> **Small bash ASIDE:** `.bash_profile` is for code to be only run once, like modifying environment variables such as `PATH`. `.bashrc` is for code to be run every time a new shell is started.

## Data Types

### Numerical Types

**Integer Type**

These are \*_all_ valid integers:

```lisp
-1
1
1.
+1
```

_fixnum_

- Its range depends on the machine: `M-: RET (print most-positive-fixnum) RET`

_bignum_:

- Can have arbitrary precision
- Most languages implement this with a _linked list_

**Floating Point Type**

All of these are the _floating point_ number 1500:

```lisp
1500.0
+15e2
15.0e+2
+1500000e-3
.15e4
```

### List Type

```lisp
(A 2 "A")       ; list of 3 elements
()              ; list of no elements (empty list)
nil             ; also the empty list
("A ()")        ; list of 1 element: the string "A"
(A ())          ; list of 2 elements: A and empty list
((A B C))         ; list of 1 element: a list with three elements
```

You can split lists across multiple lines:

```lisp
'(rose
  violet
  daisy
  buttercup)
```

Remember the quote is necessary because we want the list _itself_ and not to evaluate its contents.

**What could be the output of evaluating any list?**

- Error message
- Nothing (returns the list itself using `quote`)
- Treat the first symbol in the list as a command and return its result `(+ 2 2)` -> `4`
- Evaluate an expression from a buffer directly with `C-x C-e` or `C-j`

### Other Types

**Function Type**

All functions are defined in terms of other functions except for a few called **primitive functions** written in C.

A **lambda expression** can be called as an _anonymous function_. This is useful because many functions only need to be used once.

**Character Type**

Uses ASCII encoding; a character in ELisp is nothing more than an integer

**Symbol Type**

```lisp
foo             ; symbol named 'foo'
FOO             ; symbol named 'FOO'
1+              ; symbol named '1+'
\+1             ; symbol named '+1'
\(*\ 1\ 2\)     ; symbol named '(* 1 2)' (you're an idiot)
```

**Boolean Type**

True is `t` and false is `nil`.

## Common Functions

- `quote` returns object, without evaluating it

  ```lisp
  (quote (+ 2 2))
  '(+ 2 2)
  ```

- `car` returns the first element in a list

  ```lisp
  (car '(rose violet daisy buttercup))
  ; rose
  ```

- `cdr` returns the rest of the list

  ```lisp
  (cdr '(rose violet daisy buttercup))
  ; (violet daisy buttercup)
  ```

- `cons` constructs lists

  ```lisp
  (cons 'I '(like lisp))
  ; (I like lisp)
  (cons (car '(rose violet daisy buttercup)) (cdr '(rose violet daisy buttercup)))
  ; (rose violet daisy buttercup)
  ```

- `append` attaches one list to another

  ```lisp
  (append '(1 2 3 4) '(5 6 7 8))
  ; (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
  (cons '(1 2 3 4) '(5 6 7 8))
  ; ((1 2 3 4) 5 6 7 8)
  ```

## Exercises

```lisp
quote (1 2 3))                      ; (1 2 3)
'(1 2 3)                            ; (1 2 3)
(list (+ 1 2) '(+ 1 2))             ; (3 (+ 1 2))
(cons (+ 1 2) '(3 4))               ; (3 3 4)
(+ 10 (car '(1 2 3)))               ; 11
(append '(1 2) '(3 4))              ; (1 2 3 4)
(reverse (append '(1 2) '(3 4)))    ; (4 3 2 1)
(cdddar (1 2 3 4 5 6 7))            ; ERROR (unless cdddar defined)
```

## Customizing Emacs

Some Emacs jargon:

| Term   | Meaning                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| Point  | Current position of the cursor  |
| Mark   | Another position in the buffer  |
| Region | Text between the mark and point |

The function `point` returns the current position of the cursor as a number.

`save-excursion` is often used to keep point in the location expected by the user:

```lisp
(save-excursion
    (actions-that-modify-point))
```

**TIP:** You can use `(global-set-key KEY COMMAND)` to define a custom key bind.

### Example Customization

<!-- This was originally part of the midterm review in week4.md. -->

**Explain how to arrange for Emacs to treat C-t as a command that causes Emacs to issue a message like this in the echo area:**

_some time string I missed it lol_

Solution:

1. Define a function.
2. Use `current-time-string` to get current time, and use `concat` to concetatne time with other text
3. Make the function `interactive`
4. Use `message` for output in the echo area
   ```lisp
   (defun print-time ()
       (interactive)
       (message (concat "It is now" (current-time-string) ".")))
   ```
5. Create the `C-t` key binding:
   ```
   M-x global-set-key C-t print-time RET
   ```

## ASIDE: Concept of Pure Functions

Also known as **deterministic**, functions that have two properties:

1. Given a specific input `x`, the function _always_ returns the same output `y`.
2. It doesn't modify any data beyond initializing local variables required to compute its output.

```c
// Pure
int f(int p) {
    int q = 5 * p * p;
    return q;
}

// Impure
int z;
int f(int p) {
    return p * z++;
}
```

Notice that as long as you're using or modifying a global mutable variable, your function risks not being a pure function.

Functional languages...

- Are only composed of functions
- Can't change variable state (no `p = p + 1`).
- No loops, only recursion (because the counter `i` changes its state).
- Order of execution is not important because all functions are pure, so they won't have any _side effects_ by definition.
