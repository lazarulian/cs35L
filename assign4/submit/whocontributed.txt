To find the information about who created the line "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information" I followed a few steps that led me to the conclusion that it was Arthur David Olson.

To find this, I used the command:
    git log -G "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

This gave a log of the entire git history of that line that was searched using regular expression. 
Although Paul Eggert made some modifications, it was merely on formatting while Arthur David Olsen made the first edit of this phrase on December, 21, 1995.
