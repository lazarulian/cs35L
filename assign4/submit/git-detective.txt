To find the changes that resulted, I used git --grep "git merge-tree" to show the most recent log of changes that occured with that statement. 
In the log, I searched for the changes that fixed the problem that was outlined in the spec and came to the following commit.

Then, I compared the commit with the ancestor of theat commit to see the changes using the following command.
git diff 0b55d930a69692c7f4e7b90e35fa41f6c46df4bc~ 0b55d930a69692c7f4e7b90e35fa41f6c46df4bc

First, when looking at the object that was created that initially caused the segmentation fault, the declaration changed from returning nothing (void) to returning an integer number when called.
static int write_tree(struct object_id *result_oid,
+                     struct string_list *versions,
+                     unsigned int offset,
+                     size_t hash_size)
Furthermore, later in the changes, when the tree is called, we use an if statment to signify the return value as -1 if the tree's value is < 0. This allows us to return early if we are not looking at a clean merge.
Basically, the author started implementing return values from creating the object that signified whether the merge was successful or not, and returns when the merge was not successful.
The result value is stored in result->clean, and returns an error when that is set to -1.
